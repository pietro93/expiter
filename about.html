              Expiter is a tool aimed at helping those who live or are planning to move to Italy make more informed decisions. <b>We help expats and travellers access and digest information 
              about the "best" places to live in Italy</b>. </br></br>
              We collect and display data about different Italian cities and provinces, including but not limited to: climate data, cost of living, healthcare, transport, safety, nightlife and so on; 
              with a special attention to feedback from expats, exchange students, and digital nomads.

              We collect and combine data from different sources, such as the open-source yearly <a href='https://lab24.ilsole24ore.com/qualita-della-vita/'>Quality of Life Rankings from IlSole24Ore</a>, 
              housing price indexes from <a href="https://www.immobiliare.it/">Immobiliare.it</a>, user reviews from <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/">TripAdvisor</a>, as well as our own surveys and feedback 
              collected directly from expats and nomads in Italy.</br></br>
              When creating our city rankings for Expiter, we weight our data in order to make feedback from expats and those who moved to Italy from other countries have a higher impact on our scores compared to data sourced from people who were born and raised in Italy. 
            </br></br>This means that our data more closely reflects the experience and feedback of expats in Italy compared to that of locals, and our results may be substantially different from those of the sources we partially rely on.
