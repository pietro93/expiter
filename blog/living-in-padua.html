ecosystems.<br><br>Padua has implemented various measures to improve its environmental performance, such as limiting the car access, promoting the public transportation, encouraging the bike use, and supporting the green economy.<br><br>However, Padua also faces some environmental challenges, such as air pollution, noise pollution, and urban sprawl. <hr><h3>Is Padua walkable? </h3><h3></h3>Padua is a fairly walkable city, especially in the historic center where most of the attractions are located.<br><br>The public transport system is efficient and affordable, with buses, trams, and trains connecting different areas of the city and the region.<br><br> There are also bike-sharing services and bike lanes for cyclists.<br><br>The city has many cultural and artistic sights to explore on foot, such as the Scrovegni Chapel, the Palazzo della Ragione, the Basilica of Saint Anthony, and the Prato della Valle.<br><br> There are also several parks and gardens, such as the Botanical Garden, the oldest in the world, and the Parco Iris, a green oasis along the river.<br><br>Some challenges for walkers are the cobblestone streets, which can be slippery and uneven, and the traffic, which can be busy and noisy.<br><br> The city also has a ZTL (limited traffic zone) in the center, which restricts the access of cars and requires a permit.<br><br><br><span
