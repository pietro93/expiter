Margarine	6.38	2.13	3	Fat	Margarine is a spread made from vegetable oils or animal fats. It is used as a substitute for butter in cooking and baking.	Margarine is lower in saturated fat than butter, but it may contain trans fat, which can increase the risk of heart disease. Margarine also has less vitamin A and D than butter.	Margarine has a very low amount of lysine, which is an essential amino acid that the body cannot produce. Lysine is important for protein synthesis, collagen formation, and immune function.	Margarine also has a very low amount of arginine, which is a semi-essential amino acid that the body can produce in limited amounts. Arginine is important for nitric oxide production, blood vessel dilation, and wound healing.	Margarine has a high lysine-arginine ratio, which means that it has more lysine than arginine. This ratio may affect the balance of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the body, as lysine inhibits and arginine promotes HSV replication. A high lysine-arginine ratio may help prevent or treat HSV infections.		use the data i am going to share with you to create a table: the first column is the name of the food, keep it the same remove the second column about weight of the food change the following columns so they display mg content for 100g of food for lysine and arginine respectively add a column with the category of the food e.g. dairy, fruit, vegetable, poultry, fish, seafood add a column that introduces the food in one or two simple paragraphs with natural language and simple wording add a column that provides more info about the food and health considerations add a column that provides considerations for the food as a source of lysine, in a natural language add a column that provides considerations for the food as a source of arginine, in a natural language add a column that provides considerations about the lysine-arginine ratio in the food specifically, in a natural language with simple wording in the example Ice Cream, Rich 148 327 150 2.180 148 is the weight of the food in grams. 327 is the lysine mg content for 148 grams of food. 150 is the arginine content per 148 grams of food. you need to update the lysine and arginine content so that they are for 100 grams of food the table you need to provide must contain these columns: 1 FOOD ITEM 2 Lys (mg/100g) 3 Arg (mg/100g) 4 Ratio Lys/Arg 5 Category 6 Introduction 7 More Information 8 Lysine Considerations 9 Arginine Considerations 10 Lysine-Arginine Ratio Considerations.

Oregano oil does not contain any lysine, which is an essential amino acid that the body cannot produce. Lysine is important for protein synthesis, collagen formation, and immune function.	Oregano oil does not contain any arginine, which is a semi-essential amino acid that the body can produce in limited amounts. Arginine is important for nitric oxide production, blood vessel dilation, and wound healing.	Oregano oil has a neutral lysine-arginine ratio, which means that it does not affect the balance of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the body. However, oregano oil may have other benefits for HSV prevention or treatment, such as antiviral and antimicrobial properties.																
Hempseed Oil	0	0	1	Oil	Hempseed oil is a liquid fat obtained from the seeds of hemp, a variety of the cannabis plant. It is used as a dietary supplement, a cooking oil, and a skin care product.	Hempseed oil is high in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), which is an omega-6 fatty acid that can reduce inflammation, improve skin health, and regulate hormone levels. Hempseed oil also contains omega-3 fatty acids, which can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and cognitive decline. Hempseed oil does not contain any psychoactive compounds, such as THC, that are found in other parts of the cannabis plant.	Hempseed oil does not contain any lysine, which is an essential amino acid that the body cannot produce. Lysine is important for protein synthesis, collagen formation, and immune function.	Hempseed oil does not contain any arginine, which is a semi-essential amino acid that the body can produce in limited amounts. Arginine is important for nitric oxide production, blood vessel dilation, and wound healing.	Hempseed oil has a neutral lysine-arginine ratio, which means that it does not affect the balance of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the body. However, hempseed oil may have other benefits for HSV prevention or treatment, such as anti-inflammatory and omega-6 properties.																
Milk chocolate	210	540	0.389	Chocolate	Milk chocolate is a type of chocolate that contains milk solids, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients. It has a creamy texture and a sweet flavor.	Milk chocolate is a popular snack and dessert, but it also has some health drawbacks. Milk chocolate is high in calories, fat, and sugar, which can contribute to weight gain, diabetes, and tooth decay. Milk chocolate also contains caffeine and theobromine, which can cause nervousness, insomnia, and headaches in some people.	Milk chocolate has a low amount of lysine, which is an essential amino acid that the body cannot produce. Lysine is important for protein synthesis, collagen formation, and immune function. Milk chocolate can provide about 3% of the recommended daily intake (RDI) for an adult.	Milk chocolate has a moderate amount of arginine, which is a semi-essential amino acid that the body can produce in limited amounts. Arginine is important for nitric oxide production, blood vessel dilation, and wound healing. Milk chocolate can provide about 15% of the RDI for an adult.	Milk chocolate has a low lysine-arginine ratio, which means that it has more arginine than lysine. This ratio may affect the balance of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the body, as lysine inhibits and arginine promotes HSV replication. A low lysine-arginine ratio may increase the risk of HSV outbreaks.																
Dark chocolate (60-69% cocoa)	210	1000	0.21	Chocolate	Dark chocolate is a type of chocolate that contains cocoa solids, cocoa butter, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients. It has a bitter-sweet flavor and a firm texture. The percentage of cocoa indicates the amount of cocoa solids in the chocolate.	Dark chocolate is considered a healthier choice than milk chocolate, as it has more antioxidants, flavonoids, and polyphenols, which can protect the cells from oxidative stress, lower blood pressure, and improve blood flow. Dark chocolate also has less sugar and fat than milk chocolate, which can help prevent obesity and diabetes. However, dark chocolate still has some drawbacks, such as caffeine and theobromine, which can cause nervousness, insomnia, and headaches in some people.	Dark chocolate has a low amount of lysine, which is an essential amino acid that the body cannot produce. Lysine is important for protein synthesis, collagen formation, and immune function. Dark chocolate can provide about 3% of the RDI for an adult.	Dark chocolate has a high amount of arginine, which is a semi-essential amino acid that the body can produce in limited amounts. Arginine is important for nitric oxide production, blood vessel dilation, and wound healing. Dark chocolate can provide about 28% of the RDI for an adult.	Dark chocolate has a very low lysine-arginine ratio, which means that it has much more arginine than lysine. This ratio may affect the balance of HSV in the body, as lysine inhibits and arginine promotes HSV replication. A very low lysine-arginine ratio may significantly increase the risk of HSV outbreaks.																
Dark chocolate (70-85% cocoa)	200	1100	0.182	Chocolate	Dark chocolate is a type of chocolate that contains cocoa solids, cocoa butter, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients.

Arginine is important for nitric oxide production, blood vessel dilation, and wound healing. Dark chocolate can provide about 31% of the RDI for an adult.	Dark chocolate has a very low lysine-arginine ratio, which means that it has much more arginine than lysine. This ratio may affect the balance of HSV in the body, as lysine inhibits and arginine promotes HSV replication. A very low lysine-arginine ratio may significantly increase the risk of HSV outbreaks.
