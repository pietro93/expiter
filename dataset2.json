        "Introduction": "Margarine is a spread made from vegetable oils or animal fats. It is used as a substitute for butter in cooking and baking.",
        "MoreInfo": "Margarine is lower in saturated fat than butter, but it may contain trans fat, which can increase the risk of heart disease. Margarine also has less vitamin A and D than butter.",
        "LysineConsiderations": "Margarine has a very low amount of lysine, which is an essential amino acid that the body cannot produce. Lysine is important for protein synthesis, collagen formation, and immune function.",
        "ArginineConsiderations": "Margarine also has a very low amount of arginine, which is a semi-essential amino acid that the body can produce in limited amounts. Arginine is important for nitric oxide production, blood vessel dilation, and wound healing.",
        "RatioConsiderations": "Margarine has a high lysine-arginine ratio, which means that it has more lysine than arginine. This ratio may affect the balance of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the body, as lysine inhibits and arginine promotes HSV replication. A high lysine-arginine ratio may help prevent or treat HSV infections."

        "Introduction": "Bass is a common name for several species of fish that have a large mouth and a spiny dorsal fin. They are popular game fish and are prized for their firm, white flesh and mild flavor. Bass can be found in freshwater or saltwater, and are usually sold fresh or frozen.",
        "MoreInfo": "Bass is high in protein, selenium, phosphorus, and vitamin B12. It also contains moderate amounts of mercury, which can be harmful if consumed in excess. Bass consumption should be limited to avoid mercury poisoning, especially for pregnant women and children.",
        "LysineConsiderations": "Lysine is an essential amino acid that supports immune function, collagen synthesis, and calcium absorption. Bass provides a high amount of lysine, which may help prevent or treat cold sores, herpes, and osteoporosis.",

        "LysineConsiderations": "Lettuce, romaine is a good source of lysine, as it provides about 21% of the RDI per 100 grams. Lysine is an essential amino acid that is important for collagen synthesis, immune function, and calcium absorption.",
        "ArginineConsiderations": "Lettuce, romaine is a low source of arginine, as it provides only about 7% of the RDI per 100 grams. Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that is involved in nitric oxide production, wound healing, and urea cycle.",
        "RatioConsiderations": "Lettuce, romaine has a high lysine-arginine ratio, which means that it may be beneficial for people who have herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. HSV requires arginine for replication, and lysine may inhibit its growth. Therefore, foods with a high lysine-arginine ratio may help prevent or reduce HSV outbreaks."
