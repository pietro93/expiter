The city centre is not big and so it can be discovered on foot. The best way to discover every corner of the city is on foot but in order to reach other areas inside the city using the public system is a good idea - also because the public transport system is efficient and the means of transport run on time and are clean.

<h4>BUS, TRAIN AND CABLEWAY</h4>
Bolzano has an excellent public transport system, which includes buses, cableways and commuter rail. Within Bolzano, you can get a single trip ticket (including a second trip, if within 45 minutes after the printing) for the bus for €1.50. If you want to use the bus many times and/or with other people, you can buy the "Value Card" ("Wertkarte" or "Carta Valore") for €5, €10 or €25. In city buses the trip will cost just €1.20 and you can use this card on all types of transport system in South Tyrol: on the interurban buses, on the cableways of the SAD System, on the "Mendelbahn" and on all the trains from Innsbruck to Trento and on all urban buses in 14 other towns (Meran, Brixen, Schlanders, Bruneck, Laives/Bronzolo/Vadena, Mals, Toblach, Kaltern, Algund, Lana, Eppan, Neumarkt, Sterzing and Sand in Taufers) and in Innsbruck (here you have to stamp your ticket at the green stamping machines at the train station). Tickets can be bought at the ticket machine directly on the bus, which sell single trip tickets and €5 value cards. It accepts coins only if you are likely to buy a value card - and bus drivers will not change banknotes for money. Ticket can be bought also in a few tobacco and newspapers shops throughout the city.

There is also a 7-day travel card for one of three areas for €15. South Tyrol is divided in a western, a central and an eastern area, but the Bolzano bus network is included in all of them. If you are also planning to visit the metropolitan area, the Mobilcard for the Central area is the best option. There is a 50% young person's discount.

You have to stamp your ticket also if you are buying it at the ticket machine. You have to buy another ticket if you stop and you catch a bus after 45 minutes after the printing (only with single trip ticket or spent value card).

All timetables and bus maps you can find free in the tourist offices or in the bus station.
All urban buses stops are request stops (except end of the line): If you want to get off press the red (in some buses blue) button, while if you want to get on a bus you have to wave your hand. Especially if you are alone at the bus stop or generally in South Bolzano (Fair Quarter) and in the night you should signal well in advance.

&nbsp;South Bolzano-Fair Quarter train stationBolzano also has two small urban rail stations (Bolzano South-Fair Quarter and Sigmundskron-Ponte Adige). Also here you can use the "Value Card". A single trip ticket from the Central Station to the Bolzano South-Fair Quarter costs €1.50 (€0.65 with value card).
You have to stamp your ticket in the rail station's entrance at the green stamping machines.

<h4>TAXI</h4>
In Bolzano taxis are not so common, and sometimes at night getting a taxi can be difficult because there is no bus service and everyone will use them.
There are taxi ranks in front of the railway stations, on Walther Square, Gries Square and other major squares and places.
Taxis are only on call available. Bozen's taxi service is powered by Radio Taxi Funk 24-hr ☏ .

Non-residents may park their cars there free only from 13:00 on Saturday until 08:00 on Monday. Fares for covered car parks are around €1 per hour. If you are coming from the surrounding areas it's better to park on the outskirts - parking, e.g., in the Milan street (only €0.30 per hour) or in the Fair Quarter.
