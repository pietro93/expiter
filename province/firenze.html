<p><b>Florence</b> (Italian: <i>Firenze</i>) is the capital of the region of Tuscany in Italy, with a population of about 383,000 (2016). The city is a cultural, artistic and architectural gem, and is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The birthplace of the Italian Renaissance, Florence was the home to powerful families, creative geniuses and scientific masterminds who left their legacies in the city's many museums and art galleries. The city also has a very rich literary history, being the birthplace of the famous poet Dante, and standard Italian today is primarily based on the dialect of Tuscan spoken in Florence.

<h4>WALKING</h4>
<p>Most of the major tourist sights in Florence are within easy walking distance of each other. It is possible to walk from one end of the historic center of Florence to the other - north-south or east-west - in a half hour. Walking is not only an easy way to get around, it also offers the chance to 'take in' much more of the city life. Be warned though, that electric motor scooters are small enough to fit where cars cannot.  They are silent but quick and in the summer they often travel into the plazas.  Some of the streets in central Florence are closed to traffic.  Many more are simply too narrow for buses to get through.  Therefore, bus and car tours are not recommended. This is a very small, very compact city that really needs to be seen by foot. And, of course, if you need to, you can always buy a new pair of shoes in Florence.
</p>
<h4>CYCLING</h4>
<p>There is a bike rental service organized by the city. Bikes can be hired at several points in the city (and returned to the same place). One of the most convenient for tourists is located at SMN station. There are other locations at many railway stations, but often with restricted opening hours.
</p><p>While there are hills north and south of the center of town, almost all of the historic center of Florence is easy for bikers, because it is as flat as a hat - flatter than that. But there is a problem: Traffic is terrible with buses, trucks, cars, motorcycles, motorbikes, bicycles, and pedestrians are fighting for almost no space.  So pay attention.
</p><p>Beyond the city bikes, some of the hotels in town provide their guest with free bicycles. Bike shops also often rent bikes and some of them organize guided bike tours in the countryside.
</p>
<h4>TAXI</h4>
<p>Taxis are available, but it may be best if you have your hotel or the restaurant you are eating at call ahead. Taxis should be called by phone and the nearest one available is sent to you through the company's radio system with its meter ticking away. In Florence, it can be difficult to hail a cab from the street curb. You either call for one or get one at the very few taxi stands. One popular taxi stand is at the central Santa Maria Novella Train Station and in a few major squares. The first taxi in the taxi stand line should be free - ask in case of doubt. Most taxis do not take credit card for payment. Be sure to have cash and ask in advance in case you only have a credit card with you. Taxis in Florence are relatively expensive. Tipping is not expected, unless the driver helps you carry luggage, etc.
</p>
<h4>BUS</h4>
<p>Another way of getting around is by using the public buses from <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.ataf.net">ATAF</a></b>. You can pay using paper tickets or by credit/debit card.
</p><p>You can tap your contactless Mastercard, Maestro, Visa or Vpay card on the card reader on the bus, it costs €1.50 and you can take unlimited buses within 90 minutes. Tap in every time you get on another bus. You can pay for yourself and up to 4 companions, just press the "Add passenger" button and tap your card again for each additional person.
</p><p>A single paper ticket costs €1.50, a carnet of 10 tickets - €14. You can buy tickets at tabacchi (shops selling tobacco, which are marked with official looking "T"s out front"), kiosks/newsagents/bars where the symbol "Biglietti ATAF" is shown, as well as at the ATAF ticketing office at the bus station outside Santa Maria Novella train station. Within 90 minutes of stamping/swiping you can hop-off &amp; hop-on on any bus of the urban ATAF network. Tickets need to be stamped when entering the bus (from the front and rear doors of buses - the central door is supposed to be exit only; though now it is more accepted to enter from the central door).  If you are unable to find a ticket vendor, the automated parking kiosks will sell one for €1.50 and accept credit cards and coins. A ticket  may also be available from the driver at €2.50 but there are no availability guarantees.
Unfortunately and completely against Italian law, it is not uncommon to see bus drivers talking merrily on their mobile phone while driving. Don't expect riders to complain about it and don't panic - they will still drive with the same non-comfortable style as when they are "only driving". Hold tight to hand rails as Florence traffic is unpredictable and frequent sudden braking is necessary. Bus rides are not by all means "smooth". Buses are "safe" but pick pocketing is quite common. Keep a close eye on your belongings and avoid showing off cash, jewelry, etc., especially in very crowded buses (especially for lines 17/23/14/22 - generally speaking, any crowded bus can give a chance to pickpockets).
</p>
<h4>TRAM</h4>
<p>There are two tram lines in the city. The first one runs from Villa Constanza Park &amp; Ride on the south-western edge of the city, just off the A-1, so most users are commuters. It runs into town through the western burbs of Scandicci and L'Isolotto to SMN main railway station (25 min), then turns north to Rifredi and the University/Hospital area. It runs daily 05:00-00:30 every three to ten minutes, and a single ride costs €1.50. The second line, opened in 2019, connects the airport and the near west side to the city centre and the Santa Maria Novella station.
</p>
<h4>DRIVING</h4>
<p>Don't even think of it - see "Get in". Just thinking of it is probably enough to incur a fine.
