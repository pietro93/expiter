The <b>population density is 455 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup></b>, making it somewhat densely populated. The male to female ratio is 1.00:1.12.<br><br>

<p><b>Genoa</b> (Italian: <i>Genova</i>, Ligurian: <i>Zena</i>) is a historic port city in northern Italy, the capital of the Liguria region. As a tourist attraction, it is often overshadowed by cities such as Rome or Venice, even though it has a long history as a rich and powerful trade centre. However, with its multitude of hidden gems behind cozy alleyways, excellent cuisine (notably fish and seafood), renovated old port, beautiful sights (including one of Europe's biggest aquariums), and its position as the European Capital of Culture in 2004, the birthplace of explorer Christopher Columbus (<i>Cristoforo Colombo</i>) is an enticing place which is gradually becoming more included in the tourism market. With its profusion of slate-roofed houses, lovely seaside villas, and several luxurious boutiques, Genoa is a must-see if you want to experience the quintessential Italy.

<h4>DRIVING</h4>
<p>Locals will say driving around the city is somewhat faster than public transportation (traffic jams at rush hours notwithstanding), but once you have reached your destination you are faced with the nightmare and frustration of looking for a nonexistent parking spot. It is not just chance that most locals switched from cars to scooters - to the extent that even finding a spot for a scooter has become difficult too. All attractions within the center are in walking distance or well served by public transportation, therefore a car is of no use at all. If you still decide to drive into the city, don't bet on available street parking (there are street parking fees anyway) go directly to a parking garage and hope not all of them are full. If you think of driving to the beach on a sunny weekend day within Genoa or in another town along the coast, forget it. Finding a parking spot in walking distance to your beach is a once-in-a-lifetime event. Use public transit instead.
</p>
<h4>PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION</h4>
<p>Public transportation will probably be your best bet within the city. The bus network is operated by AMT and services the whole city until 01:00. Be sure to check routes and timetables you need because the system can be somewhat confusing, e.g. some routes only travel at certain times and are replaced by other similar ones with different numbers at those times. There is also an underground line connecting the main square, piazza De Ferrari, with the northwestern neighborhood of Rivarolo, serving the historical center, the Porto Antico tourist area, the Stazione Principe main train station and the ferry terminal at Dinegro along the route. As is common in Italy, tickets are not sold on board (except at night or on Sundays, then at an increased price); you need to buy your ticket before boarding the bus at a newspaper kiosk or a tobacconist's or an underground station, and validate it at a punching machine once you have boarded the bus. Single tickets cost €1.60 and are valid for 100 minutes after validation for an unlimited number of travels in any direction. A daily pass costs €4.50, while a group daily pass valid for 4 persons costs €9.00. Those passes must be validated at the beginning of your first ride. If you have to catch a bus early in the morning or at late hours when the tobacconist shops are not open you should have a local cell phone. Tickets via SMS You need to send a text message with "AMT" to 48 50 209 and you will be charged €1.50. The response message is the ticket, which is valid for 110 minutes. AMT also has iOS and Android apps through which tickets can be bought. 
</p><p>There are also a number of public elevators and cable railways connecting the center with the neighborhoods on the surrounding hills. The upper stations of the <i>Ascensore di Castelletto</i> elevator and of the <i>Funicolare del righi</i> railway offer an astonishing view of the city.
</p><p>Trenitalia suburban and regional trains travel in east-west direction along the coast connecting all the coastal neighborhoods/suburbs with the city center. This is the most convenient means of transportation if you plan to see some peripheral districts or towns along the coastline. AMT tickets and passes are valid on Trenitalia trains within the city limits (Voltri and Nervi); single tickets only allow one train ride, and you must validate them again at the yellow punching machines at the stations - check for the correct validating space with the name "Trenitalia" on the back side of the ticket.
If you are travelling outside the city limits to visit some outer towns, you will have to buy a ticket at a Trenitalia counter or machine. It is advisable to buy return tickets right away because there are usually no ticket counters at minor stations and chances are good that the ticket machines there won't work, turning buying a ticket (or discussing with the conductor on the return train) into a hassle.
</p><p>The historic center of Genoa is serviced by bus only around some important squares and streets (Piazza Acquaverde for Stazione di Piazza Principe, Piazza della Nunziata, Largo Zecca, Piazza Corvetto, Piazza Caricamento). Its <i>caruggi</i> alleys are so narrow that no vehicular traffic is physically possible, and they have to be visited on foot - distances are definitely not huge anyway.
</p>
<h4>BOAT</h4>
<p>AMT also operates a public boat service called Navebus (see timetable) connecting the Porto Antico to Pegli. It is a great and cheap way to have a look at the city from the sea; once in Pegli, you can visit the Villa Pallavicini public park.
</p><p>Private boat services start from the Porto Antico and travel along the coast to Camogli, San Fruttuoso, Portofino, Chiavari and the Cinqueterre.
