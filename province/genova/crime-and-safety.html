Walks alone, especially for women, should be avoided in certain areas. It's best not to go to some coastal areas that run parallel to Via Gramschi unless absolutely necessary.<br><br> However, the city center is generally safe and busy with people walking around.<br><br> Genoa has both safer and more dangerous neighborhoods, but the city center is considered very safe, especially during the day.<br><br> The wealthiest and safest part of Genoa is the area around the university, where many students live.<br><br> The historical center and other safe neighborhoods are well-connected by public transport, even at night.<br><br> In general, Genoa is a beautiful city with a lot to offer, and safety should not be a major concern for residents or visitors who take normal precautions, especially in crowded areas and at night.<br><span class="separator"></span><br></span></section><section id="Discover"><h2>Discover</h2><span id="promo"><center><h3>Recommended Tours in Genova</h3></center><div data-vi-partner-id="P00045447" data-vi-language="en" data-vi-currency="EUR" data-vi-partner-type="AFFILIATE" data-vi-url="https://www.viator.com/Genoa/d805-ttd" data-vi-total-products="6" data-vi-campaign="Genova"></div><script async="" src="https://www.viator.com/orion/partner/widget.js"></script><br><span class="separator"></span><br><div data-gyg-widget="auto" data-gyg-partner-id="56T9R2T"></div><br><span class="separator"></span><br><h2>Crime and Safety of Provinces Nearby</h2> <row class="columns is-multiline is-mobile"> <figure class="column is-3 related"><a href="https://expiter.com/province/cuneo/crime-and-safety/"><img title="Cuneo" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cfkgj4ulo/italy-cities/CN.webp?tr=w-280,h-140,c-at_least,q-5" alt="Crime and safety in Cuneo, Piedmont"><figcaption>Cuneo, Piedmont</figcaption></a></figure><figure class="column is-3 related"><a href="https://expiter.com/province/biella/crime-and-safety/"><img title="Biella" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cfkgj4ulo/italy-cities/BI.webp?tr=w-280,h-140,c-at_least,q-5" alt="Crime and safety in Biella, Piedmont"><figcaption>Biella, Piedmont</figcaption></a></figure><figure class="column is-3 related"><a href="https://expiter.com/province/savona/crime-and-safety/"><img title="Savona" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cfkgj4ulo/italy-cities/SV.webp?tr=w-280,h-140,c-at_least,q-5" alt="Crime and safety in Savona, Liguria"><figcaption>Savona, Liguria</figcaption></a></figure><figure class="column is-3 related"><a href="https://expiter.com/province/asti/crime-and-safety/"><img title="Asti" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/cfkgj4ulo/italy-cities/AT.webp?tr=w-280,h-140,c-at_least,q-5" alt="Crime and safety in Asti, Piedmont"><figcaption>Asti, Piedmont</figcaption></a></figure></row></span></section></div><aside class="menu sb mobileonly"><p class="menu-label">Province Overview</p><ul class="menu-list"><li><a href="https://expiter.com/province/genova/">Genoa Province Overview</a></li><li><a href="http://expiter.com/comuni/province-of-genova/">Municipalities in Genoa</a></li><li><a href="https://expiter.com/app/?sort=Name&amp;region=Liguria">Provinces in Liguria</a></li></ul><p class="menu-label">Get Inspired</p><ul class="menu-list"><li><a href="https://expiter.com/"><b>Province Comparison Tool</b></a></li><li><a href="https://expiter.com/app/?sort=Expat-friendly&amp;region=Liguria">Best Places to Live in Liguria</a></li><li><a href="https://expiter.com/app/?sort=Cheapest&amp;region=Liguria">Cheapest Provinces in Liguria</a></li><li><a href="https://expiter.com/app/?sort=Climate&amp;region=Liguria">Provinces in Liguria with the best climate</a></li><li><a href="https://expiter.com/app/?sort=Safety&amp;region=Liguria">Safest provinces in Liguria</a></li></ul><br><p class="menu-label">Experience</p><div data-gyg-widget="auto" data-gyg-partner-id="56T9R2T"></div><br><p class="menu-label">About</p><p class="about">Expiter is a data visualization tool for researching and comparing different quality of life factors in Italian cities and provinces.<br><br>We provide valuable information for expats, exchange students, full-time travelers, remote workers and digital nomads who are living in (or planning to move to) Italy. </p><br><p class="menu-label">Disclaimer</p><p class="disclaimer">The information on this website is for educational purposes only.
