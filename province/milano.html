The <b>city of Milan</b>, with 1,371,498 residents, is the second-most popolous city and <b>industrial, commercial and financial capital of Italy</b>.<br><br>The larger Milano metropolitan area comprises <b>133 towns</b> (comuni) and covers an area of 1.575 km<sup>2</sup>. The <b>population density is 2 071 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup></b>, making it somewhat densely populated. The male to female ratio is 1.00:1.07.<br><br>
<p><b>Milan</b> (Italian: <i>Milano</i>; Milanese: <i>Milan)</i> is financially the most important city in Italy, and home to the Borsa Italiana stock exchange. It is the second most populous city proper in the country, but sits at the centre of Italy's largest urban and metropolitan area. While not considered as beautiful as some Italian cities, having been greatly destroyed by Second World War bomb raids, the city has rebuilt itself into a thriving cosmopolitan business capital. In essence, for a tourist, what makes Milan interesting compared to other places is that the city is truly more about the lifestyle of enjoying worldly pleasures: a paradise for shopping, football, opera, and nightlife. Milan remains the marketplace for Italian fashion – fashion aficionados, supermodels and international paparazzi descend upon the city twice a year for its spring and autumn fairs.
</p><p>Milan is famous for its wealth of historical and modern sights - the Duomo, one of the biggest and grandest Gothic cathedrals in the world, La Scala, one of the best established opera houses in the world, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, a glamorous 19th-century arcaded shopping gallery, the Brera art gallery, with some of the finest artistic works in Europe, the Pirelli tower, a majestic example of 1960s modernist Italian architecture, the San Siro, a huge and famed stadium, or the Castello Sforzesco, a grand medieval castle. So, you have your fair share of old and new monuments. Plus, it contains one of the world's most famous paintings - Leonardo da Vinci's <i>The Last Supper</i>.

<p><b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.atm.it/en">Azienda Trasporti Milanesi S.p.A.</a></b> (ATM) operates a public transport network which is pretty efficient (especially the underground lines and the trams (streetcars)). There are three payment methods: traditional paper tickets, credit/debit cards, and app.
</p><p>Single tickets cost €2.00 and are available from newsstands, tabaccherie, bars and automatic ticket machines in metro stations.  24h (€7.00), 3 days (€12.00), weekly (€17.00) tickets, as well as a "carnet" of 10 single trips (€18.00) are available from most newsstands (including subway newsstands), tabaccherie (tobacconist - look for large T sign), coffee bars and the tourist information office.
</p><p>If your journey starts with the Metro, you can also use contactless credit/debit cards and in this case fees are limited so that you do not pay more than the 24 hr rate on any day. If you are staying for a few days it is cheaper to buy a paper 3 day or weekly ticket. Only certain turnstiles are equipped with card readers so look for the orange signage.
</p><p>There is an ATM app for iOS and Android that you can use to buy single or daily tickets.
</p><p>When boarding the bus or tram or entering the metro system through the turnstiles, you need to validate your ticket by pushing it into a ticket machine. For single tickets, the machine will print time and date on the ticket and from that time it's valid for 90 minutes. During that time the ticket allows unlimited travel on trams and buses, one entry to the metro (you may transfer between metro lines but not exit) and one ride on the urban part of the suburban train.
</p><p>There still exist three different types of ticket machines on trams and buses. To validate the new-style paper with magnetic strip tickets (these should be the only ones that you will ever be sold) you need to use the orange and yellow machines. If you have a new magnetic credit-card type ticket, you should validate it every time you board on a new bus or a streetcar as well.
</p>
<h4>METRO</h4>
<p>The <b>Metro</b> (short for Metropolitana, the logo is a big white <b>M</b> on a red background) has four lines, each commonly identified by a color as shown below, and is the best way to get around Milan. The lines are: <span title="Metropolitana di Milano, linea 1 (Rho Fiera / Bisceglie - Sesto 1 Maggio)" style="background-color:#ee2e24; border:2px solid #ee2e24; border-radius:0px; font-size:70%;">&nbsp;<span style="color:white; font-weight:bold;white-space:nowrap;">M1</span>&nbsp;</span> (<i>rossa</i>); <span title="Metropolitana di Milano, linea 2 (Assago Milanofiori Forum/Abbiategrasso - Cologno Nord/Gessate)" style="background-color:#5d9732; border:2px solid #5d9732; border-radius:0px; font-size:70%;">&nbsp;<span style="color:white; font-weight:bold;white-space:nowrap;">M2</span>&nbsp;</span> (<i>verde</i>); <span title="Metropolitana di Milano, linea 3 (Comasina - San Donato)" style="background-color:#fdb813; border:2px solid #fdb813; border-radius:0px; font-size:70%;">&nbsp;<span style="color:white; font-weight:bold;white-space:nowrap;">M3</span>&nbsp;</span> (<i>gialla</i>); <span title="Metropolitana di Milano, linea 5 (San Siro Stadio - Bignami)" style="background-color:#9a8fc5; border:2px solid #9a8fc5; border-radius:0px; font-size:70%;">&nbsp;<span style="color:white; font-weight:bold;white-space:nowrap;">M5</span>&nbsp;</span> (<i>lilla</i>). The <span title="Metropolitana di Milano, linea 4 (San Cristoforo - Linate Aeroporto)" style="background-color:#0283be; border:2px solid #0283be; border-radius:0px; font-size:70%;">&nbsp;<span style="color:white; font-weight:bold;white-space:nowrap;">M4</span>&nbsp;</span> is under construction, to be completed by 2022, as are many other extensions of existing lines. The subway network is the most extensive in Italy (lines split into different sections and its 113 stations cover most areas of town). During peak hours trains run every 2 minutes on M1 and M2, every 4 minutes on M3 and on M5. Service starts around 6:00AM and the last trains run around midnight. From midnight to 6:00AM there is a substitute bus line (NM1, NM2, NM3 - M5 line doesn't have a bus line) running every 30 minutes. Take into account that the NM2 travels only inside Milan proper, between the station of Cascina Gobba and Abbiategrasso, while the NM1 travels between  Molino Dorino and Sesto San Giovanni (excluding Rho and Rho Fieramilano) and between Bisceglie and Cadorna (where you can transfer for further stops along the M1 line).
</p>
<h4>TRAM</h4>
<figure class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><noscript><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Tram_in_Milan.jpg/220px-Tram_in_Milan.jpg" decoding="async" width="220" height="198" data-file-width="2200" data-file-height="1980"></noscript><span class="lazy-image-placeholder" style="width: 220px;height: 198px;" data-src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Tram_in_Milan.jpg/220px-Tram_in_Milan.jpg" data-alt="" data-width="220" data-height="198">&nbsp;</span><figcaption>One of the city's easily recognisable historic tramcars in the old, orange livery.</figcaption></figure><p>Trams (<i>streetcars</i>) run above-ground on rail lines running through the streets.
</p><p>Being above ground means you get a view of what you're passing, so if you don't need to go far, they're convenient and fun. Some tram lines are operated by the ultramodern 'jumbo' yellow tram, others are run by orange antique traditional carriages (older than many in museums in other cities) with wooden panelling inside and glass chandeliers. Most tram stops have electronic information panels with indications on how many minutes to wait before the next available service and a line scheme with all stops. Ticket are not available on board, but there are electronic dispensers in all metro stations, or buy from newsagent kiosks in metro stations.
</p><p>ATM also organizes dinners on a special restaurant tram (ATMosfera), you can enjoy your dinner while strolling the city on the old streetcar.
</p>
<h4>BUS</h4>
<p>Buses should probably be your third public transport option. Equally comfortable, rather punctual and clean with many routes to choose from. Lines usually stop between midnight and 2AM, however, some lines, especially in the suburbs, end their service earlier. There are 11 lines (N6, N15, N24, N27, N42, N50, N54, N57, N80, N90/91 and N94) that run every night with a frequency of 30 minutes, connecting the city center to suburbs and most major streets. In any case check your route and timetable in advance if you want to travel late at night.
</p><p>From 8PM to 2AM a special shuttle service is operated by ATM, called Radiobus, an on-call bus accessible only by pre-booking. Radiobus is a good, cheap and efficient alternative to taxis. You may book them by phone at 02 4803 4803 at least 20 minutes in advance (a couple of hours is better). The bus will stop at a dedicated place (these have an hexagonal panel with blue writing <b>RADIOBUS</b> and telephone number on white) and will leave you virtually any place. Memorize the pick-up location. The driver will wait for ladies to enter the home door as a courtesy. Costs €2 per person. You may buy the tickets in advance, or pay on the bus.
</p><p>Several buses connect suburban cities and towns surrounding Milan. Some are managed by ATM. You can travel on most of them with an inter-urban ticket (biglietto interurbano) which are sold in two forms: including travel in Milan or without. In the without form you can only go to the end of the line, while with the cumulative version you can transfer to any ATM line. There are several rules and distance limits which apply, so be aware of them when you purchase your ticket.
</p><p>Most bus stops have electronic information panels with indications on how many minutes to wait before the next available service.
</p>
<h4>TAXI</h4>
<p>Taxis can be expensive and drivers are allowed to pick passengers up from designated taxi ranks, through phone bookings and directly from the sidewalk of a street. The main taxi companies can be reached at 02.40.40, 02.69.69 or 02.80.80, or alternatively, from a land line dial 848.814.781 to be connected to the nearest taxi stand. If you book a taxi by phone you'll start paying from the moment the driver accepts the call and comes to pick you up.
</p><p>Local law define some fixed fee trips: Milan to Malpensa Airport €70, Malpensa Airport-Rho Fair €55, Malpensa Airport-Linate Airport €85, Linate Airport-Milan Fair €40. All fees are intended for a one-way, non-stop trip; taxi waiting time and booking are extras. A surcharge will apply in the evenings so don't be surprised if the meter has €6+ on it when you enter, even if at a taxi-stand.
</p>
<h4>TRAIN</h4>
<p>The <b>Suburban Railway System</b> or <b>S-lines</b> (the logo is a big green <b>S</b> on a blue background) includes a special line known as <b>Passante ferroviario</b> (railway link), considered Milan's fifth subway line (although trains run every 6-15 mins), and has eight more lines, each identified by a number (S1, S2, S5, S6, S12, S13 through Passante Ferroviario and S3, S4, S8, S9, S11 through other railways), connecting metro area towns with Milan.  Suburban trains run less often than Metro trains (usually every 30 minutes or 1 hour) but, as some lines share tracks and stations, you can expect as many as 10 trains per hour in central Milan between Lancetti and Porta Vittoria stations. Suburban Railway 'S' Lines are usually marked in blue on subway maps. The Passante is not heavily used by the Milanese and in non-peak hours stations can be deserted so would not be recommended for lone (and particularly female) travellers.

<h4>DRIVING</h4>
<p>Driving is definitely not a good idea to get into the city centre. Like most major cities traffic is a considerable problem, not to mention the hassle of parking. During working hours traffic is often blocked, inside the city as well as on the highway ring surrounding it. It is much better at night, but you'll probably have problems finding a place to leave the car near enough to nightlife attractions.
</p><p>If you must drive in Milan make sure you have an up-to-date map showing the many one-ways present in the city.

<h4 class="in-block"><span class="mw-headline" id="Traffic_congestion_fee">Traffic congestion fee</span></h4>
<p>Since January 1, 2008, cars entering Milan's central area within the former walls of the city (<i>cerchia dei navigli</i>) must pay a fee (€2,€3, €5 or €10 depending on the engine and age of the car), the fee and the fee area are both known as Area C. There are no exemptions for foreign cars (cars with a foreign licence plate).
</p><p>There are cameras in all entrances to this area and all registration plates are recorded. Payment can be made by purchasing entrance cards at newspaper stands, online or by sms (call 020202 for information). Failure to pay within 48 hours from entering the area implies a fine of €75.
</p>
<h4 class="in-block"><span class="mw-headline" id="Car_sharing">Car sharing</span></h4>
<p>There are two car sharing services in the city, <i>Car2Go</i> and <i>Enjoy</i>. With a small rental, from 25 to 29 cents per minute, it's possible to rent a Smart car or a Fiat 500, respectively, in order to move freely within the city. There are no extra costs, and even the congestion charge is included in the rent.
</p>
<h4>WALKING</h4>
<p>Walking is definitely a possibility, and although Milan is a large city, many of the main tourist attractions are within an easy and pleasant walk from one another. Several tourist hot spots, such as the Corso Vittorio Emanuele or the Via Dante are pedestrian-only, so walking shouldn't be a problem. No matter how hot the day, you'll see elegantly dressed people of both sexes in timeless fashion without a drop of sweat. There are many places to sit, apart from the ubiquitous cafes, especially in the parks. Get a decent map of the city before setting out though, as the roads do not always maintain a straight line, and the various piazzas can be confusing to the newcomer. In the many parks, there are dog-only areas, but be careful when walking as the two things you will see on the ground in the streets are cigarette ends and dog faeces.
</p>
<h4>BIKE</h4>
<p>Bikes are available through the bike sharing service BikeMI. You can register for annual or temporary subscriptions at any BikeMi station. If you register for a temporary subscription (weekly or daily), a user code, along with your password, will be sent to the e-mail address, chosen during your registration. Your codes are active as soon as you receive them. BikeDistrict is a website that offers cycling directions to get around safely in the city. Entering the departure and destination addresses, BikeDistrict finds the best itinerary for bikes, avoiding as far as possible cobblestones, tram rails, busy streets and the routes which are potentially dangerous for cyclists. The suggested route is displayed on a map and colored according to the cycling level of every street, together with real-time information about bike sharing stations and with the location of cycling-related services, such as bike repair shops.
