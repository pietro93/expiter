Traffic in Naples can be extremely heavy, similar to that of other big cities like Paris and New York. Extensive excavation works are ongoing to complete some metro segments, adding further to traffic in some areas. A typical example is the train station area, which is undergoing a complete makeover (a model of how it will look is observable in the interior of Stazione Centrale), plus the excavation of a metro line connecting it with Capodichino Airport. Another example is Piazza Nicola Amore (commonly known as Piazza Quattro Palazzi because of the four twin buildings surrounding it), where metro line excavations revealed an ancient Roman temple, whose structure will be integrated in the futuristic station designed by the world-class architect Renzo Piano.
Normal traffic regulations are generally observed in Naples; however, it is prudent to follow the locals when crossing the street. Since pedestrians often cross the street in the middle of the block, Neapolitan drivers are very attentive, and accidents are very rare. Remember to always look left (and not right) for incoming cars or motorbikes, since circulation follows European standards.

<h4>TAXI</h4>
Taxis and the Metro are the quickest ways to see Naples. Taxis are the most expensive way, though. Before getting into a taxi, make sure it is licensed. Licensed taxis will have a city crest on the door and a taxi number. Also, make sure it has a meter. By law, licensed taxis must display a list of set fares in a number of languages (Italian, English, French, German, Spanish). Check for such fares and agree to them before starting the journey.

<h4>WALKING</h4>
You will be surprised how easily you can get around by foot, too. Interesting spots are almost on every corner and most distances – especially in the (historic) centre – are small and can be walked in a matter of minutes.

<h4>SCOOTER</h4>
A good alternative to get around is by renting a scooter, there are many providers to choose from and the prices are relatively economical. If you feel confident on the road, this is a good way to avoid the heavy traffic and the confusing public transport. Motorists in Naples are notoriously assertive on the road, so always make sure to respect the local laws and be aware of other drivers around you. 


<h4>PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ON LAND</h4>
&nbsp;Metro system in 2011. "Municipio" and "Garibaldi" stations are not highlightedNaples' public transportation system is fairly difficult to understand for the first time visitor, since different lines are operated by different companies and sometimes interexchange is not allowed between different providers.
Nevertheless, the creation of the organization UnicoCampania with the aim of managing an integrated fare system for the whole region of Campania, has seen a real simplification of the tarifs. Within city limits, integrated tickets are available for use on any kind of vehicle and company. They exist at the price of €1.60 for one hour of validity, and €4.50 for a day. Besides, a Corsa Semplice ticket, valid for one ride in only one transport company, is available at the fare €1.10.
Tickets can be bought at any authorized selling point. A very common place to find them away from railway or Metro stations is tobacco shops (Tabaccheria, easily identified by a big white "T" on a rectangular black field) or newspaper shops. They are not sold on board the trains or buses. Passengers are randomly checked for having a ticket by authorized personnel. Not having a ticket results into a huge fine, with no exceptions, since in Italy this act is a tax offense.

Metropolitana di Napoli. There are three lines of underground subway in Naples. They are always monitored by cameras and security officers, which both protects passengers, and deters them from marking graffiti or otherwise behaving uncivilly.
Line &nbsp;1&nbsp;, managed by Azienda Napoletana di Mobilità (ANM), connects the city center to the hill quarters, like Vomero and the hospitals area. Avoid passing through Piscinola and Secondigliano as those areas can be very dodgy and dangerous.
Line &nbsp;2&nbsp;, actually a commuter rail service operated by Trenitalia, crosses the city from west to east and have 10 stations within city limits. At Garibaldi, Cavour-Museo and Mergellina, it connects to subway lines. The tracks are shared with regional rail services of Trenitalia to Caserta, Castellammare di Stabia, Salerno and Pozzuoli.
Line , also managed by ANM, is a light subway connecting Fuorigrotta to Mergellina. The line has only 4 stops, but there are plans to expand it to the port.&nbsp;The funicular train stopped at the Via Morghen station in VomeroFunicolare. ANM also operates the four cable cars lines &nbsp;Centrale&nbsp; &nbsp;Chiaia&nbsp; &nbsp;Mergellina&nbsp; &nbsp;Montesanto&nbsp;. The first one connects Via Toledo to the hilly neighborhood of Vomero, the second runs from the elegant area of Chiaia to Vomero, the third connects the coast of Mergellina to the hill of Posillipo while the last one runs from the historic centre to Vomero.
Trams. ANM operates two tram lines (1 and 4), of which one goes along the shore of Santa Lucia - Castelnuovo - Garibaldi (Central Station).
Buses. ANM also operates all bus lines within Naples, most of which are circular. Naples suffers from a serious problem of traffic jams and usually buses are overcrowded, so try to avoid them if you can (except for evenings and weekends).Three different regional train companies that operated in Naples and surrounding areas (Circumvesuviana, SEPSA and MetroCampania NordEst) were in December 2012 incorporated by merger into the historic company Ente Autonomo Volturno (EAV), which at the time ran its own fleet of intercity and highway buses. Since then, EAV is in charge of management and improvement of most of the regional public transport by rail:

Circumvesuviana &nbsp;. Founded in 1889, the former Circumvesuviana railway operates from its own terminal station of 40.849214.26936 Napoli Porta Nolana. All routes pass through the underground station Piazza Garibaldi (which connects to Napoli Centrale and city subway) before splitting into 6 branches to towns in the eastern part of the province. An interesting route goes from Naples to Sorrento in about one hour, with several stops in between, including Pompei Scavi (from where it is an easy foot walk to the main entrance to Pompeii ruins) and Ercolano (Herculaneum). A second route travels around the northern flanks of Mt. Vesuvius and on to Sarno. Other routes go to Acerra, Nola and Baiano.
Cumana. This line operates from Napoli - Montesanto, the original end station of SEPSA. It follows the coastline to the west of the city for approximately 20&nbsp;km before ending in Torregaveta (Bacoli). The line runs through the urban centres of Montesanto, Fuorigrotta, Bagnoli, Pozzuoli, Arco Felice, Baia and Fusaro, before reaching Torregaveta.
Circumflegrea.  It also starts in Napoli - Montesanto and ends in Torregaveta. However, it runs further inland than the Cumana line, along the districts of Soccavo, Pianura, Quarto Flegreo, Licola and Cuma. It is approximately 7 km longer than the Cumana. Because both lines start and end in the same terminal stations, users can quickly transfer from one train to the other and complete an interesting tourist loop though the Phlegraean Fields.
Arcobaleno &nbsp;. The Rainbow Line, thus called because of the characteristic colors of its stations, also known as Linea Metropolitana EAV since the merger in 2012, starts from station Napoli - Piscinola, where it connects with Line 1 of the underground subway. It's a 10.5-km-long, totally underground journey, which connects the northern suburbs of Naples, passing though Mugnano, Giugliano and Aversa.The EAV website has more information on timings, routes and cost of tickets.
In addition to the EAV trains, national railway company Trenitalia also operates regional trains to many destinations in the province: Formia-Castellamare, Naples-Capua and Naples-Salerno. All these services share the railway of Metro Line 2 when crossing the city.

<h4>FERRY AND HYDROFOIL</h4>
&nbsp;Metrostar convoy of CircumvesuvianaThere are several ferry and hydrofoil services that connect Naples and local ports and islands. Ferry and hydrofoil services leave from either 40.83735214.2547497 Molo Beverello&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;, 40.8433614.261048 Porta di Massa (approx. 1 km by foot from Beverello), 40.82884914.2227159 Mergellina&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp; or 40.82371214.11793510 Pozzuoli&nbsp;&nbsp;Cumana&nbsp;. Some then of them are listed here:

Metrò del Mare has several lines that connect Naples and Sapri; Bacoli and Salerno and Sorrento; Monte di Procida and Salerno; and, Amalfi and Sapri. Besides the main stops the ferry service also connects many smaller communities. The Metro del Mare webpage has schedules, timetables and location of ticket counters. It seems to only operate in summer.
L.N.G. [formerly dead link] has a hydrofoil service that connects Naples with the island of Capri, along with Sorrento, Positano and Amalfi. Schedules and timings can be found on its website.
AliLauro has a hydrofoil service that connects Naples with the islands of Ponza, Ventotene, Procida, Ischia, Capri and Eolie, and the towns of Formia, Castellamare, Sorrento, Positano, Amalfi and Salerno. Alilauro operates from both the Molo Beverello and Mergelina.
MedMar, Caremar and SNAV operate hydrofoils and ferries.Reaching one of the islands in the gulf by ferry can take up to 70 minutes (hydrofoils are much faster, but more expensive).
For most of the year, the sea is calm, and in any case when it happens to be rough the boats' runs are stopped. In any case, it is advised to follow the normal measures for sea travel. In particular, if you are sensible to the rolling of the ships, or travel with young children, consider taking an appropriate medication. Ferries also have open decks, which are particularly attractive and scenic to use in spring and summer. The sunlight is bright here, so cover up or use sunscreen to prevent sunburns.
Be sure to check for dolphins or sea turtles while traveling toward Capri, in particular. Loggerhead sea turtles are quite common, and Naples' Aquarium also hosts a renowned veterinary unit, whose specialty is to recover and heal wounded turtles and get them back to the sea.
