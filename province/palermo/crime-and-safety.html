has a deep-rooted history of mafia influence, dating back to the mid-19th century when private armies, or 'mafie', were hired by absentee landlords to protect their estates from bandits.<br><br> Over time, these 'mafie' evolved into a powerful criminal organization that expanded its activities beyond just providing protection, engaging in extortion, arbitration of disputes, and the oversight of illegal agreements and transactions.<br><br> By the 20th century, the Mafia had become entrenched in Palermo's political, economic, and social fabric, wielding significant influence and control.<br><br> The Mafia's presence in Palermo has been marked by periods of both suppression and resurgence.<br><br> In the 1920s, Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini's appointed prefect, Cesare Mori, launched a crackdown that temporarily disrupted the Mafia's operations.<br><br> However, the organization regained strength after the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, when many imprisoned mafiosi were released and reinstated in positions of power.<br><br> The 1980s and 1990s were particularly turbulent years for Palermo, as the Mafia's influence and criminal activities escalated, leading to an increase in violence and high-profile assassinations targeting anti-Mafia figures, such as the 1992 killings of judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino.<br><br> Despite ongoing efforts by law enforcement and the Italian government to combat the Mafia's grip on Palermo, the city remains a stronghold of organized crime, with the Cosa Nostra continuing to exert its power and control over various aspects of life in the Sicilian capital.<br><span class="separator"></span><br></span></section><section id="Accidents"><h3>Accidents</h3><span id="accidents">In the province of
