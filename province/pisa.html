The <b>population density is 171 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup></b>, making it somewhat densely populated. The male to female ratio is 1.00:1.06.<br><br><p>
<b>Pisa</b> is a city in Tuscany, Italy, best known for its world-famous leaning tower. But the tower isn't the only thing to see – there are other architectural and artistic marvels in this beautiful city. The half-hour walk from the Campo dei Miracoli to the train station runs through a pedestrian street with many interesting sights, shops, and restaurants. The best way to visit Pisa is walking the streets, as the city centre is small and cosy, and enjoying the sight and the atmosphere.

<p>In the city centre, just walk.
</p>
<h4>BUS</h4>
<p>The <b>LAM</b> or city buses run frequently to 18:00 then sparsely to 23:00. The most useful route is <i>LAM Rossa</i>, the red line, between railway station, riverside (stop <i>Lungarno Pacinotti 2</i>) and Leaning Tower (stop <i>Piazza dei Miracoli</i>). <i>LAM Verde</i> runs near the airport.
</p><p>Tickets for both LAM and out-of-town buses are €1.50 single, a pack of ten is €14. Single tickets can also be purchased from the bus driver for €2.50. Tickets must be validated on boarding the bus; they are then valid for 70 minutes.
</p>
<h4>CYCLING</h4>
<p>Pisa has a public bicycle service called Ciclopi which allows travellers pick up and drop cycles to and from 15 points around the city. They have a mobile app Bicincittà, but the only way to register is to come in person to their point of sales: INFOPOINT piazza del Duomo 7 (in front of the Cathedral), every day 09.30 - 17.30; LA GALLERIA DEL DISCO via San Francesco 96, every day 09.00 - 20.00; SOLFERINO TABACCHI piazza Solferino 11, from Monday to Saturday 08.00 - 13.00 and 15.30-20.00. Possible subscriptions:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Daily</b>: €5, including €1 of credit.</li>
<li><b>Weekly</b>: €10, including 2€ of credit.</li></ul><p>Subscriptions include unlimited free rides up to 30 minutes. And then €0.9 for the second half hour, €1.5 for the third half hour, €2 for all subsequent half hours.
</p>
<h4>DRIVING</h4>
<p>Not in the city centre: many streets are either pedestrianised or restricted to residents (ZTL, <i>Zone a traffico limitato</i>, camera-enforced but easy to stray into accidentally). Those streets that you can drive into are narrow, one-way, congested, and with next-to-no parking. Ask ahead at your accommodation for parking and permitted approach routes. For day-trips, Pisa Tower Parking is €1.80 per hour and close to the main sights.
</p><p>You do however need a car to explore the villages in the hills of Tuscany. Consider hiring from the airport and either picking up late or dropping back early there, and just use public transport for Pisa, Lucca and Florence.
</p><p><b>By taxi</b>
</p><p>Taxis can be an expensive way to move around the city. They aren’t really needed in the center due to the size of Pisa, but if you are arriving at the airport and don’t want to walk they are a good option. If going to anywhere near the train station they would only be better than the Pisamover costwise if you are travelling in a group of 3 or more people.
</p><p>The legal fares can be found on the CoTaPi website.
