The <b>city of Rome</b>, with 2.761.632 residents, is the most popolous city and <b>capital of Italy</b>.<br><br>The larger Roma metropolitan area comprises <b>121 towns</b> (comuni) and covers an area of 5.352 km<sup>2</sup>. The <b>population density is 810 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup></b>, making it highly densely populated. The male to female ratio is 1.00:1.09.<br><br>

<p><b>Rome</b> (Italian and Latin: <i>Roma</i>), the 'Eternal City', is the capital and largest city of Italy and of the Lazio region. It's the famed city of the Roman Empire, the Seven Hills, <i>La Dolce Vita</i>, the Vatican City and <i>Three Coins in the Fountain</i>. Rome, as a millennia-long centre of power, culture and religion, was the centre of one of the greatest civilisations ever, and has exerted a huge influence over the world in its circa 2500 years of existence.
</p><p>The historic centre of the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With wonderful palaces, thousand-year-old churches and basilicas, grand romantic ruins, opulent monuments, ornate statues and graceful fountains, Rome has an immensely rich historical heritage and cosmopolitan atmosphere, making it one of Europe's and the world's most visited, famous, influential and beautiful capitals. Today, Rome has a growing nightlife scene and is also seen as a shopping heaven, being regarded as one of the fashion capitals of the world; some of Italy's oldest jewellery and clothing establishments were founded in the city. With so many sights and things to do, Rome can truly be classified a "global city".

<p><b>In a nutshell: Don't do it.</b> Well, some people actually enjoy it as a master class in defensive driving. Roman traffic is chaotic (and has been since the first century BC), but it is possible to drive there. However, the roads are not logical, the signs are few and the condition of the roads gets worse daily. It will take a few weeks to understand where to drive, to get where you want to go. When driving in Rome it is important to accept that Italians drive in a very pragmatic way.  Taking turns and letting people go in front of you is rare, but pedestrians are usually grudgingly yielded to. Motorbikes and scooters are driven fearlessly, darting in and out of traffic and splitting lanes. There is little patience so if the light is green when you go into the intersection and you are too slow they will let you know. A green light turning to amber is a reason to accelerate, not brake, in part because the lights usually stay amber for several seconds. If you brake immediately when the light changes you are likely to get rear-ended. <b>Parking is so scarce, that in some areas you may have to leave your car kilometers away from your destination.</b> Rome is plagued with people who demand money to direct you to a space, even on the rare occasions when there are many places available, however the locals can make anywhere a parking space by flashing their hazard-lights, even if it looks like they are getting away with it, do not try this. While in Rome, it is far better to travel by bus or metro, or (<i>in extremis</i>) take a taxi.
</p><p>In the centre, many areas are limited to drivers with special electronic passes. If you go into these areas (which are camera controlled and marked with the sign <i>ZTL</i>) you will end up with a large fine, particularly if your car has Italian plates.
</p>
<h4>TAXI</h4>
<table class="pp_infobox" style="float:right; clear:right; margin-left: 1em; width:40%;" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color:#effafa; font-size:90%; border:1px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1em; padding-right: 1em; text-align:left; width:100%;">
<p><strong>Fake taxis</strong>
</p><p>Some private citizens dress up their cars to look like cabs. These people strategically locate themselves at airports and railway stations waiting for travellers. Beware of operators who don't display a licensed meter and ID. Use only authorised taxis (white vehicles  with a taximeter) that are available in the arrivals areas of the terminals. Also, some airport employees may direct you to a 'Taxi' driver if you ask where you find them when you are inside the airport terminal. The 'Taxi' could end up being a Mercedes limo, costing you double the fare of a real taxi, and a tricky situation to get out of as your luggage is locked away in the limo's trunk.
</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Taxis are the most expensive way to get around Rome, but when weighed against convenience and speed, they are often worth it.  Roman taxis run on meters, and you should always make sure the driver starts the meter. Taxis will typically pick you up only at a taxi stand, which you will find at all but the smallest piazzas, as well as at the main train station or when called by phone. Flagging down a taxi is possible but quite rare as the taxi drivers prefer to use the stands. When you get in the cab, there will be a fixed starting charge, which will be more for late nights, Sundays and holidays. Supplements will be requested for bags that the driver has to handle, typically €1 per bag. So, if you have a limited amount of luggage that wouldn't need to go in the trunk, you may decline when the driver offers to put your bags in the trunk. Drivers may not use the shortest route, so try to follow the route with a map and discuss if you feel you're being tricked.
</p><p>When you phone for a taxi, the cab's meter starts running when it is summoned, not when it arrives to pick you up, so by the time a cab arrives at your location, there may already be a substantial amount on the meter. A major problem is that taxi drivers often leave the previous fare running on the meter. So you may find the cab arriving with €15 or even more on the meter. If you are not in a hurry you should tell him (there are very few female cab drivers in Rome) to get lost, but if you are desperate to get to the airport it's a different matter. You can get a taxi pretty easily at any piazza though, so calling ahead is really not required. A trip completely across the city (within the walls) will cost about €11 if starting at a cab rank, a little more if there is heavy traffic at night or on a Sunday.  Taxi drivers can often try to trick customers by switching a €50 note for a €10 note during payment, leading you to believe that you handed them only €10 when you have already given them €50.
The main taxi companies may be called at <b>060609</b>, <b>063570</b>, <b>065551</b>, <b>064994</b>, <b>066645</b> and <b>0688177</b>.
</p><p><b>Taxi-hailing apps</b> like "Free Now" and "itTaxi" are convenient, allow payment by credit card in the app, and reduce your risk of being scammed. <b>Uber Black</b> is available, providing high-end vehicles that cost more per trip than taxis.
</p>
<h4>WALKING</h4>
<figure class="mw-halign-right" typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><noscript><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Directions_Rome.JPG/250px-Directions_Rome.JPG" decoding="async" width="250" height="183" data-file-width="3288" data-file-height="2401"></noscript><span class="lazy-image-placeholder" style="width: 250px;height: 183px;" data-src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Directions_Rome.JPG/250px-Directions_Rome.JPG" data-alt="" data-width="250" data-height="183">&nbsp;</span><figcaption>Directions for pedestrians on a wall near Piazza Navona</figcaption></figure><p>Once you're in the centre, you are best off on foot. What could be more romantic than strolling through Rome on foot holding hands? That is hard to beat!
</p><p>Crossing a street in Rome can be a bit challenging. There are crosswalks, but they are rarely located at signalled intersections. Traffic can be intimidating, but if you are at a crosswalk just start walking and cars will let you cross the street. While crossing watch out for the thousands of mopeds. As in many European cities, even if the cars and trucks are stationary due to a jam or for another legal reason, mopeds and bikes will be trying to squeeze through the gaps and may be ignoring the reason why everyone else has stopped. This means that even if the traffic seems stationary you need to pause and look around into the gaps.
</p>
<span id="By_public_transport_.28ATAC.29"></span><h4>PUBLIC TRANSPORT (ATAC)</h4>
<p>ATAC operates the public transit network. There are three ways of buying public transport tickets in Rome: app, credit/debit card, or the traditional paper tickets. The paper tickets offer the most types of tickets but the other options may be more convenient for you.
</p><p>The nugo app offers single and 24/48/72 hour tickets on their Android or iOS app. As noted below, the daily tickets are quite expensive and it may be more beneficial to just buy single tickets.
</p><p>If you start your journey on the metro, you can touch in using your contactless credit/debit card. You may continue your journey on a bus or tram without further validation within the 100 minute limit. You are charged €1.50 per touch in, and this is capped to a maximum of €7/day. Bus or trams don't have card readers so you can't start your journey there.
</p><p>Paper tickets must be bought (from a 'Tabacchi' - look for the big 'T' sign, these shops are plentiful, or from a kiosk selling newspapers) before you board the bus, Metro, or tram. Metro stations have automated ticket kiosks, and major Metro stations have clerked ticket windows. Some of the rare trams have single ticket machines as well. Tickets for regular ATAC buses, Metro, and trams are the same fares and are compatible with each other. Ticket options are as follows (Oct 2019):
</p>
<ul><li>a single ticket ride ('Biglietto Integrato a Tempo' or BIT) - €1.50 - you can change buses or into and out of the metro on one journey (valid for 100 minutes)</li>
<li>24 hours Ticket ('Biglietto 24 ore') - €7 (Valid for 24 hours).</li>
<li>48 hours Ticket ('Biglietto 48 ore') - €12.50 (Valid for 48 hours).</li>
<li>72 hours Ticket ('Biglietto 72 ore') - €18 (Valid for 72 hours).</li>
<li>Integrated Weekly Ticket ('Carta Integrata Settimanale') - €24 (Valid for 7 days).</li>
<li>Monthly Pass ('Abbonamento Mensile')  - €35</li>
<li>Annual Pass ('Abbonamento Annuale') - €250</li></ul><p>When you board the bus or metro you have to <b>validate the ticket</b> ('convalidare') in the little yellow machine. The last four types of ticket on the list above must be validated the first time you use them only. On the whole, the integrated passes are not economical. Unless you take many rides spread all over the day, the single ticket ride option is preferable. Calculating if a pass is worth it is easy since a single ticket ride costs €1.50. For example, for a daily ticket (€7) to be worth it, you would have to make 5 or more trips at intervals greater than 100 minutes apart on a single day. Many visitors just walk through the city in one direction and take a single ride back.
</p><p>ATAC polices the buses, Metro, and trams for people riding without tickets. Inspectors can be rare on some buses, although they tend to increase their presence in the summer. Inspectors are present on the Metro as well, and you should keep your validated ticket throughout your journey as proof-of-payment. If you don't have sufficient money on you to pay the fine, they will actually escort you to an ATM to pay the fee.  If you don't have an ATM card to withdraw money, you will be asked to pay by mail, and the fee goes up to €140. Inspectors can also fine you for getting in and out of the wrong door, even if the bus is empty! The entrances are the front and rear doors and the exit in the middle. Many Romans ignore this distinction.
</p><p>The <b>Roma Pass</b> includes full access to the public transport system. There is also an alternative pass called <b>OMNIA Vatican and Rome</b> which includes the services provided by Roma Pass. Read the <i><a href="/wiki/Rome#Roma_Pass" title="Rome">See section</a></i> for details.
</p>
<h4 class="in-block"><span class="mw-headline" id="Journey_planner">Journey planner</span></h4>
<p>You can find real-time information about bus waiting times, as well as a journey planner, at Muoversi a Roma or its lighter version (perhaps an older one). Transit maps and directions area also available on Apple Maps (requires an internet connection), and Google Maps (can be downloaded for offline use).
</p>
<h4 class="in-block"><span class="mw-headline" id="Bus">Bus</span></h4>
<p>Roman buses are reliable but crowded. They are the best way to get around the city (except walking). Free maps of the bus system are available. Others can be purchased (€3.5 at Termini).  Signs at the bus stop list the stops for each route. Ask for assistance. In Rome, there is always somebody nearby who speaks English.
</p><p>Some bus lines have arrivals every ten minutes or so. Less popular routes may arrive every half hour or less. If heading outside the centre beware that bus schedules can be seriously disrupted by heavy traffic. Quite often trips just get cancelled.
</p><p>Do not rely on counting the number of stops  to the destination. The signs on the stops mention only the major streets where the bus stops, but there may be 3 or 5 stops for each one. Instead, ask the driver or consult with your GPS.
</p><p>Useful bus lines are:
</p>
<ul><li><b>23</b> San Paolo - Ostiense - Piazza Risorgimento (St. Peter and Vatican Museums).</li>
<li><b>40</b> Stazione Termini - St. Peter. The 40 arches from the Termini station through the historic centre and then up to the Castel Sant'Angelo, near the Vatican. It is considered an express route, so its stops are spaced about 800 m (1/2 mile) apart; but it is also very frequent, very convenient for most places that the Metro does not go to, and very fast, especially compared to other routes.</li>
<li><b>64</b> Stazione Termini - Corso Vittorio Emanuele II - St. Peter. The 64 also goes from Termini to the Vatican. It is a favourite with pickpockets.</li>
<li><b>75</b> Stazione Termini - Forum Romanum - Colosseum - Testaccio - Trastevere.</li>

<li><b>117</b> San Giovanni in Laterano - Colosseum - Piazza di Spagna - Piazza del Popolo.</li></ul><p>The 116 and 117 are little electric buses which wind through the Centro Storico; 117 does not work on holidays.
</p>
<ul><li><b>Night buses</b> could be useful due to the closing of the Metro stations at 23:30 and the stopping of regular lines of buses and trams at midnight. During the summer (until 23 September) and on Fridays and Saturdays, the frequency of the rides is halved, which can vary among 10, 15, 30 and 35 minutes depending on the line. In any case they are much more punctual than during the day, as traffic is much less jammed. This makes the drivers drive at high speeds, allowing passengers to experience a strange mixture of adrenaline and (the city's) classical views. Hubs of the night buses are Termini and Piazza Venezia. All the bus lines have the prefix "N"; N1 and N2 routes are similar to metro line A and B respectively, N28 for line C.</li></ul><h4 class="in-block"><span class="mw-headline" id="Tram">Tram</span></h4>

The number 8 does run into the centre to Largo Argentina, not far from the Pantheon, and terminate at Piazza Venezia. If you want to catch a soccer game at one of the stadiums in the north of the city, catch the tram (2) just north of the Piazza del Popolo. Number 19 links the Vatican with Villa Borghese.

<h4 class="in-block"><span class="mw-headline" id="Metro">Metro</span></h4>
<p>There are two lines that cross at Termini station: line <span title="Metropolitana di Roma, linea A (Battstini - Anagnina)" style="background-color:#f36c1b; border:2px solid #f36c1b; border-radius:0px; font-size:70%;">&nbsp;<span style="color:white; font-weight:bold;white-space:nowrap;">A</span>&nbsp;</span> runs northwest past the Vatican and southeast, and line <span title="Metropolitana di Roma, linea B (Laurentina - Rebibbia)" style="background-color:#0072bc; border:2px solid #0072bc; border-radius:0px; font-size:70%;">&nbsp;<span style="color:white; font-weight:bold;white-space:nowrap;">B</span>&nbsp;</span> runs southwest past the Colosseum and northeast in one direction, but also splits at the "Bologna" station to go due north until Jonio. Line <span title="Metropolitana di Roma, linea C (Monte Compatri-Pantano - San Giovanni)" style="background-color:#008850; border:2px solid #008850; border-radius:0px; font-size:70%;">&nbsp;<span style="color:white; font-weight:bold;white-space:nowrap;">C</span>&nbsp;</span> runs from San Giovanni station to the eastern suburbs.
</p><p>All lines open at 05:30 and stop running at 23:30, except Fridays and Saturdays, when the last trains leave from the stations at 01:30. The Metro is the most punctual form of public transportation in Rome, but it can get extremely crowded during rush hour. See safety warning in the Stay Safe section.
</p>
<h4>COMMUTER RAIL</h4>
<p>There is a network of suburban rail lines that mostly connect to smaller towns and conurbations of Rome. Tourists are unlikely to use these, except when arriving from Fiumicino, but they can be very convenient if you fancy a day-trip out of Rome (see Go next).
</p>
<h4>MOPED</h4>
<p>There is the possibility to hire motor bikes or scooters. Many Romans prefer this way of transportation, even in winter you can see them driving scooters equipped with raincoats, blankets, and rain boots. Motorbikes are not particularly safe in Rome and most accidents seem to involve one (or two!). Nevertheless, Roman traffic is chaotic and a scooter provides excellent mobility within the city. Scooter rental costs between €30 and €70 per day depending on scooter size and rental company. The traffic can be intimidating and the experience exciting but a bit insane.

</ul><h4>CYCLING</h4>
<p>There is the possibility to hire any kind of bike in Rome: from tandem, road bikes, children bikes to trekking bikes. Some shops are even specialised only on high quality ones while street stands will hire you cheaper and heavy ones. Bicycling alone can be stressful because of the traffic. The best way is to discover first how to move around and avoid traffic and stress with a guide thanks to one of the tours offered by almost all rental shops. There are different itineraries offered from the basic city centre, panoramic Rome tour to the Ancient Parks (from €29 for 4h). The experience is well worth it and you would reduce also your impact on the city environment and on the traffic.

While the Roman traffic is certainly chaotic to someone from a country with more regimented and enforced rules of the road, Roman drivers are, generally speaking, used to seeing bicycles, as well as scooters and motorcycles, and one may move throughout the city relatively easily. If you are in a car's way, they will generally let you know with a quick beep of the horn and wait for you to move.
</p><p>A particularly spectacular, and relaxing, cycle trip is to pedal out along <i>la Via Appia Antica</i>, the original Appian Way that linked much of Italy to Rome. Some of the original cobblestones, now worn by over 2 millennia of traffic, are still in place. With exceptionally light traffic in most sections, you can casually meander your bike over kilometres of incredible scenery and pass ancient relics and active archaeological sites throughout the journey.

</ul><h4>SEGWAY PT</h4>
<p>It is now possible to rent a Segway in Rome. It is a fast and convenient way to get around in the city centre. In Rome, a person on a Segway is considered a pedestrian, not a motorist, so Segways are only allowed on the sidewalks, not in the streets with vehicles. Segway rental costs between €25 and €50 per hour, or between €70 and €100 for an accompanied tour of 2–4 hours.
