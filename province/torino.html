The <b>population density is 330 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup></b>, making it somewhat densely populated. The male to female ratio is 1.00:1.07.<br><br><p>
<b>Turin</b> (Italian: <i>Torino,</i> Piedmontese: <i>Turin</i>), a large city of about one million inhabitants, is set in the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy, an hour's drive from the French border and slightly more than that from the Mediterranean sea. It's famous for being the home of Italy's royal family. Today, Turin, with its fine, aristocratic atmosphere, old world sophisticated shops, grand boulevards and palaces, leafy parks, and several art galleries, is an increasingly popular tourist resort. The 2006 Winter Olympics, and its status the same year as World Book Capital, have prompted tourists to visit this beautiful and underestimated Italian city, which has a longstanding cultural and artistic history.

<p>Turin has an efficient, integrated system of buses, trams and metro all operated by GTT. These run 06:00-00:30, and out of hours there are night buses fanning out from Piazza Vittorio Veneto. A comprehensive network map is available on the GTT website. On 5T website it's also possible to check real-time running. Route planner is available online.
</p><p>You must buy your ticket before you get on and validate it as soon as you board. All <i>tabaccherie</i> (tobacconists) sell transport tickets as do some bars and kiosks at stations. There are also vending machines at the metro stations. The standard ticket is the "City + Suburban 100", valid for 100 mins for unlimited bus rides plus one journey on the Metro. In 2021 this costs €1.70; daily, 48-hr and 72-hr tickets are available for €4, €7.50 and €10 respectively. Longer season tickets will need photo ID. The spot fine for travelling with an unvalidated ticket, or without one, is €25.
</p><p>Bus and tram stops are clearly marked with yellow signs, and display maps of the city routes. There may be electronic indicators at the stop and on board.
</p><p>The <b>Metro</b>, opened in 2006, is as of 2021 a single line, <b>Linea 1</b>, with driverless trains. The southern terminus is Bengasi. The line runs north to <b>Lingotto</b>, near the mainline Lingotto train station, the Lingotto Conference, Exhibition &amp; Trade Centre, <i>Eataly</i> and the Automobile Museum. The line continues north under Via Nizza stopping at Spezia, Carducci, Dante, Fermata 8226 and Marconi to <b>Porta Nuova</b> railway station. It there turns west beneath Corso Vittorio Emmanuele II stopping at Re Umberto and Vinzaglio, then north again to <b>Porta Susa</b> railway station and Piazza XVIII Dicembre. It then runs west under Corso Francia into the suburbs, stopping at Principi d'Acaja, Bernini, Racconigi, Rivoli, Monte Grappa, Pozzo Strada, Massaua, Marche, and Paradiso to end at <b>Fermi</b>. Fares are the same as for buses, eg a 100-min single journey including bus transfers is €1.70, it's automatically validated by passing the platform entrance gates.
</p><p><b>Out-of-town:</b> the GTT network and ticket includes the suburbs, but further out it's mostly the blue buses run by Sadem (including to the airport, see "Get in"). Again, try to buy your ticket before boarding, eg at a tobacconist, café or news stand. Consider also buying the return if you're going to a quiet spot that may lack facilities. You can probably buy your ticket on the bus, but this will cost maybe an extra euro, and the driver will grind his gums if he has to give change.

<h4>CYCLING</h4>
<figure class="mw-default-size" typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><noscript><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Bike_sharing_Torino_Porta_Nova.jpg/220px-Bike_sharing_Torino_Porta_Nova.jpg" decoding="async" width="220" height="147" data-file-width="5184" data-file-height="3456"></noscript><span class="lazy-image-placeholder" style="width: 220px;height: 147px;" data-src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Bike_sharing_Torino_Porta_Nova.jpg/220px-Bike_sharing_Torino_Porta_Nova.jpg" data-alt="" data-width="220" data-height="147">&nbsp;</span><figcaption>A ToBike stand</figcaption></figure><p>The city has a network of bicycle paths, though they're not all in good condition, and pedestrians will try to claim right of way. On the roads, cars and motor scooters will scythe across your path, and as for the trams . . .
</p><p>A bike-sharing service is operated by <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tobike.it/default.aspx">ToBike</a>.</b> They have some 140 bike stations across the city, and their website shows real-time availability of bikes and docking stations. But first you have to register - easy if you're a resident, and your card is mailed to you within a couple of days. That doesn't work for short visits, so try presenting yourself at the Tobike shop in Via Santa Chiara 26/F, or at Turismo Torino in Piazza Castello. There are other outlets (eg <i>Eataly</i> in Lingotto) but they only sell annual cards. There's also an app you can use, <i>Bicincittà</i>, then access bikes by your mobile instead of by a card, it's not clear if this gets around the problem of not having a local mailing address.
</p><p>Choose your Tobike card period: €5 for one day, €8 for one week or €25 for one year. Your first 30 mins on the bike is free, for unlimited trips providing you dock the bike between trips. Thereafter charges apply, up to the maximum permitted use of four hours.
</p><p>Similar services are run by <b>oBike</b> and <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://mobike.com/uk/">Mobike</a> <sup class="error-deadlink noprint">[dead link]</sup></b>, use their Android / iPhone apps to register.
</p>
<h4>DRIVING</h4>
<p>You don't need a car in town, and driving here is not for the faint-hearted. You need to beware the many restricted-entry streets, trams, and other motorists who may regard red lights and speed limits as merely advisory.
</p><p>A good central parking garage is beneath Piazza Vittorio Veneto is <span class="vcard"><span class="noprint listing-coordinates" style="display:none"><span class="geo"><abbr class="latitude">45.065004</abbr><abbr class="longitude">7.695082</abbr></span></span><span title="See this element on the map"><a class="mw-kartographer-maplink mw-kartographer-autostyled" data-mw="interface" data-style="osm-intl" href="/wiki/Special:Map/17/45.065004/7.695082/en" data-zoom="17" data-lat="45.065004" data-lon="7.695082" style="background: #228B22;" data-overlays="[&quot;mask&quot;,&quot;around&quot;,&quot;buy&quot;,&quot;city&quot;,&quot;do&quot;,&quot;drink&quot;,&quot;eat&quot;,&quot;go&quot;,&quot;listing&quot;,&quot;other&quot;,&quot;see&quot;,&quot;sleep&quot;,&quot;vicinity&quot;,&quot;view&quot;]">1</a></span> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://bestinparking.it/garage/torino/piazza-vittorio-veneto"><span id="Parcheggio_Vittorio_Park" class="fn org listing-name" style="font-weight:bold;">Parcheggio Vittorio Park</span></a></span>
</p><p><b>Car rentals:</b> as well as the airport rental kiosks, there are down-town rental offices, eg Hertz just outside Porta Susa train station.
</p><p>There are three car sharing services in Turin, <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.share-now.com/it/en/turin/">ShareNow</a></b>, <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://enjoy.eni.com/en/torino/home">Enjoy</a></b> and <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://go.leasys.com/en">LeasysGO</a></b> (which uses 100% electric cars). An electric scooter sharing service is run by <b><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://mimoto.it/">MiMoto</a></b>.
</p>
<h4>TAXI</h4>
<p>Taxis in Torino start the meter the moment your call is received.  It is not customary to hail a taxi on the street, but there are taxi ranks at the main railway stations, at the corner of Via Sacchi and Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, and elsewhere. You can also book via the <b>WeTaxi</b> app.
